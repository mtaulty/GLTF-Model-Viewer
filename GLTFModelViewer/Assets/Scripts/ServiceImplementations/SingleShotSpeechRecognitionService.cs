    /// Why am I using my own speech handling rather than relying on MRTK?
    /// I started using those and they worked fine.
    /// However, I found that my speech commands would stop working across invocations of
    /// the file open dialog. They would work *before* and *stop* after.
    /// I spent a lot of time on this and I found that things would *work* under the debugger
    /// but not without it.
    /// That led me to think that this related to suspend/resume and perhaps HoloLens suspends
    /// the app when you move to the file dialog because I notice that dialog running as its
    /// own app on HoloLens.
    /// I tried hard to do work with suspend/resume but I kept hitting problems and so I wrote
    /// my own code where I try quite hard to avoid a single instance of SpeechRecognizer being
    /// used more than once - i.e. I create it, recognise with it & throw it away each time
    /// as this seems to *actually work* better than any other approach I tried.
    /// I also find that SpeechRecognizer.RecognizeAsync can get into a situation where it
    /// returns "Success" and "Rejected" at the same time & once that happens you don't get
    /// any more recognition unless you throw it away and so that's behind my approach.
